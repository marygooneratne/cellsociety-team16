### Notes


### Impressions
This project was difficult and a lot of the difficulty was rooted not necessarily in the programming of the separate parts rather in the integration of these parts and expanding upon these parts. The "complete" sprint was not merely adding upon existing code (which may have been the case if the original implementation was written dynamically enough) but rather refactoring code to make it more dynamic and flexible.
